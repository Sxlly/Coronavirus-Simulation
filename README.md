# Coronavirus-Simulation

This is a Python Program to simulate the spread of coronavirus throughout a social network:

This is supported by a GUI made with tkinter
  - to run this GUI, run file CVSimulationGUI.py 
  
  Note: 
    this file needs the following packages installed to work as intended
    
    - networkx
    - matplotlib
    - numpy
    - PIL (pillow)
    - All files avaliable within this repo
    - tkinter
    - random
    - csv
    - sys
    
    If any confusion, take a look at the package imports at the top of the CVSimulationGUI.py
    
    Note: This GUI Originally was meant to come as a .exe file made by PyInstaller, although common antivirus software is currently
          seeing this .exe as a piece of malware due to not being from a certified distribution, this can be by passed by letting your computer
          trust this application, although it may delete the application the moment the user attempts to extract the .exe
    
Thankyou for checking out this repo and program, I hope you could make use of it either for research or simply for enjoyment.
